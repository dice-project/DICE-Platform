         First, we need to pick a sensible name for deploy. Right now, we might just as well call it <b>test</b>, since this is its purpose. Next, we need to select our blueprint and resources folder we created earlier. Deployment service part should be already configured correctly, but we can modify it if we wish. We can save the deploy by pressing <b>Apply</b> button.
