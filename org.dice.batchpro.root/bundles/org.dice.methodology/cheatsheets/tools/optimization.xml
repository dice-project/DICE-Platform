   <intro>
      <description>describes the methodological steps that DICE users follow for identifying the configuration of minimum cost with the D-SPACE4Cloud tool</description>
      </intro>
   <item title="Start the optimization wizard" dialog="true">
   	<description>The optimization process is supported by a five step wizard, which starts by pressing the corresponding button or by selecting the entry Optimization Wizard from the D-SPACE4Cloud plug-in menu.
   	</description>
   </item>
   <item title="Select classes, technology and cloud deployment">
   	<description> Specify the number of classes,  the DIA target technology and the deployment (public or private).
   	</description>
   </item>
   <item title="Select optimization alternatives and DTSMs">
   	<description> For each class, specify the optimization alternatives selecting, possibly, multiple VM types at different providers candidate for the final deployment. For each VM type, select the corresponding DTSM model.
   	</description>
   </item>
   <item title="Select DDSM including the deployment model">
   	<description>For each class, select the DDSM model, which includes the deployment model of the DIA, which will be updated by D-SPACE4Cloud with the optimal solution found. 
   	</description>
   </item>
   <item title="Select Optimization constraints">
   	<description>At this step optimization constraints are specified and are technology specific. In particular, for Spark and Hadoop MapReduce, specify the minimum and maximum number of concurrent users, the DIA end usersâ€™ think time and the DIA deadline (job penalty cost can be specified only on the private cloud case). For Storm, specify the cluster maximum utilization.

   </item>
   <item title="Download the results">
   	<description>When the optimization engine finishes, the DDSM introduced at step 4 is  updated and can be used as input by the DICER tool to finally deploy the optimal solution.
