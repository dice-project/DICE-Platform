   	<description>Once all of the prerequisites are correctly installed and configured it is now possible to start the installation procedure.

   <item title="Running ADT from the IDE">
   	<description>For running the ADT from DICE IDE one can either use the predefined arguments for the tool or change the arguments before running it. In the first case, launching ADT is a matter of clicking the Launch ADT button from the DICE menu whereas for the second option, one can specify either a user created configuration file or pass the options as command line arguments for ADT. More details about how the configuration file and what are the available options for ADT can be found on the official Github ADT Wiki page ( https://github.com/dice-project/DICE-Anomaly-Detection-Tool/wiki/Getting-Started).</description>
