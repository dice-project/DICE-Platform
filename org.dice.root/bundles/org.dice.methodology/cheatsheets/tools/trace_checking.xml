   <intro>
      <description>This Cheat Sheet is mainly based on those ones for D-VerT (verification tool). The procedure to build a Storm topology follows the same lines of the one for D-VerT, briefly summarized hereafter and completed with DICE-TraCT related informationl</description>

   <item title="DIA design and verification in practice">
   	<description>The user creates the UML project and initialize a Class Diagram (DTSM) to model a Storm Topology</description>
   </item>
   <item title="DTSM modeling">
   	<description>In the DTSM package, the user specifies which technologies implement the various components of the DIA. In particular, the user models the actual implementation of the computations declared in the DPIM, plus all the required technology-specific details</description>
      <subitem
            label="Storm Modeling. Via drag-and-drop from right panel, the user adds to the design all the nodes defining the application (spouts and bolts). Then, from the bottom panel, he/she selects the proper stereotype for each component (&lt;&lt;StormSpout&gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt;StormBolt&gt;&gt;). Finally, the user connects the nodes together through directed associations. Each one defines the subscription relation between two nodes: the subscriber, at the beginning of the arrow, and the subscribed node, at the end of the arrow">

   	<description>The user activates a “Run configurations” button and in the “Run configuration” window, he/she provide the following informations</description>
