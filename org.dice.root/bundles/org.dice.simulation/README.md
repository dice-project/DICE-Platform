This plugin creates a contribution to the DICE UI including a menu entry and a preferences page entry, using the definitions of the "org.dice.ui" plugin.

If you want to check how to create new one, I recommend you to have a look at the plugin.xml file and follow the manuals of Vogella website (http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseCommands/article.html)
