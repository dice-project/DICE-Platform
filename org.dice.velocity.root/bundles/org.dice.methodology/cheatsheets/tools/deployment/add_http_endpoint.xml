Name field should contain short, descriptive name that we will use to identify this service in other dialogs. Keystore related fields can be left empty in this scenario.

If the data we entered is valid, last field in the dialog will be auto-populated for us with some default value that we can change if we wish.

If we make any error while entering the data, the error will be displayed at the top of the dialog.

When we are done, we press <b>Ok</b>.
