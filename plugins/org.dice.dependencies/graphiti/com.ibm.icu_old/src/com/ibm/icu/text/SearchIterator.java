/**
 * <p>SearchIterator is an abstract base class that defines a protocol
 * for text searching. Subclasses provide concrete implementations of
 * various search algorithms.  A concrete subclass, StringSearch, is
 * provided that implements language-sensitive pattern matching based
 * on the comparison rules defined in a RuleBasedCollator
 * object. Instances of SearchIterator maintain a current position and
 * scan over the target text, returning the indices where a match is
 * found and the length of each match. Generally, the sequence of forward 
 * matches will be equivalent to the sequence of backward matches.One
 * case where this statement may not hold is when non-overlapping mode 
 * is set on and there are continuous repetitive patterns in the text. 
 * Consider the case searching for pattern "aba" in the text 
 * "ababababa", setting overlapping mode off will produce forward matches
 * at offsets 0, 4. However when a backwards search is done, the
 * results will be at offsets 6 and 2.</p>
 * 
 * <p>If matches searched for have boundary restrictions. BreakIterators 
 * can be used to define the valid boundaries of such a match. Once a 
 * BreakIterator is set, potential matches will be tested against the
 * BreakIterator to determine if the boundaries are valid and that all
 * characters in the potential match are equivalent to the pattern 
 * searched for. For example, looking for the pattern "fox" in the text
 * "foxy fox" will produce match results at offset 0 and 5 with length 3
 * if no BreakIterators were set. However if a WordBreakIterator is set,
 * the only match that would be found will be at the offset 5. Since,
 * the SearchIterator guarantees that if a BreakIterator is set, all its
 * matches will match the given pattern exactly, a potential match that 
 * passes the BreakIterator might still not produce a valid match. For 
 * instance the pattern "e" will not be found in the string 
 * "&#92;u00e9" (latin small letter e with acute) if a 
 * CharacterBreakIterator is used. Even though "e" is
 * a part of the character "&#92;u00e9" and the potential match at
 * offset 0 length 1 passes the CharacterBreakIterator test, "&#92;u00e9"
 * is not equivalent to "e", hence the SearchIterator rejects the potential
 * match. By default, the SearchIterator
 * does not impose any boundary restriction on the matches, it will 
 * return all results that match the pattern. Illustrating with the 
 * above example, "e" will
 * be found in the string "&#92;u00e9" if no BreakIterator is
 * specified.</p>
 * 
 * <p>SearchIterator also provides a means to handle overlapping
 * matches via the API setOverlapping(boolean). For example, if
 * overlapping mode is set, searching for the pattern "abab" in the
 * text "ababab" will match at positions 0 and 2, whereas if
 * overlapping is not set, SearchIterator will only match at position
 * 0. By default, overlapping mode is not set.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The APIs in SearchIterator are similar to that of other text
 * iteration classes such as BreakIterator. Using this class, it is
 * easy to scan through text looking for all occurances of a
 * match.</p>
 * <p>
 * Example of use:<br>
 * <pre>
 * String target = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy fox";
 * String pattern = "fox";
 * SearchIterator iter = new StringSearch(pattern, target);
 * for (int pos = iter.first(); pos != SearchIterator.DONE; 
 *                                                       pos = iter.next()) {
 *     // println matches at offset 16 and 41 with length 3
 *     System.out.println("Found match at " + pos + ", length is " 
 *                        + iter.getMatchLength());
 * }
 * target = "ababababa";
 * pattern = "aba";
 * iter.setTarget(new StringCharacterIterator(pattern));
 * iter.setOverlapping(false);
 * System.out.println("Overlapping mode set to false");
 * System.out.println("Forward matches of pattern " + pattern + " in text "
 *                    + text + ": ");
 * for (int pos = iter.first(); pos != SearchIterator.DONE;

 *     // println matches at offset 0 and 4 with length 3
 *     System.out.println("offset " + pos + ", length " 
 *                        + iter.getMatchLength());

 *     System.out.println("offset " + pos + ", length " 
 *                        + iter.getMatchLength());
 * }

 *     // println matches at offset 2, 4 and 6 with length 3
 *     System.out.println("offset " + pos + ", length " 
 *                        + iter.getMatchLength());
 * }
 * System.out.println("Index set to 2");
 * iter.setIndex(2);
