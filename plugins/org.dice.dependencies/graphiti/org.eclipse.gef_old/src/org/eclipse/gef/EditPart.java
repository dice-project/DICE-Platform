/**
 * EditParts are the building blocks of GEF Viewers. As the <I>Controller</I>,
 * an EditPart ties the application's model to a visual representation.
 * EditParts are responsible for making changes to the model. EditParts
 * typically control a single model object or a coupled set of object. Visual
 * representations include {@link org.eclipse.draw2d.IFigure Figures} and
 * {@link org.eclipse.swt.widgets.TreeItem TreeItems}. Model objects are often
 * composed of other objects that the User will interact with. Similarly,
 * EditParts can be composed of or have references to other EditParts.
 * <P>
 * The creator of an EditPart should call only setModel(Object). The remaining
 * API is used mostly by Tools, EditPolicies, and other EditParts. CHANGES are
 * made to the model, not the EditPart.
 * <P>
 * Most interaction with EditParts is achieved using {@link Request Requests}. A
 * Request specifies the type of interaction. Requests are used in
 * {@link #getTargetEditPart(Request) targeting}, filtering the selection (using
 * {@link #understandsRequest(Request)}), graphical
 * {@link #showSourceFeedback(Request)} feedback, and most importantly,
 * {@link #getCommand(Request) obtaining} commands. Only {@link Command
 * Commands} should change the model.
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT: This interface is <EM>not</EM> intended to be implemented by
 * clients. Clients should inherit from
 * {@link org.eclipse.gef.editparts.AbstractEditPart}. New methods may be added
 * in the future.
