/**
 * A <code>DropTragetListener</code> that handles one type of SWT
 * {@link Transfer}. The purpose of a TransferDropTargetListener is to:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Determine enablement for a Drop operation. Enablement is often a function
 * drop location, and/or criteria.
 * <LI>When enabled, optionally showing feedback on the DropTarget.
 * <LI>Performing the actualy Drop
 * </UL> {@link DelegatingDropAdapter} allows these functions to be implemented
 * separately for unrelated types of Drags. DelegatingDropAdapter then combines
 * the function of each TransferDropTargetListener, while allowing them to be
 * implemented as if they were the only DragSourceListener.
 * 
 * @deprecated use org.eclipse.jface.util.TransferDropTargetListener instead
