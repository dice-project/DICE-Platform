This abstraction represents all elements in the Method Content as well as Process space for which concrete textual descriptions are defined in the form of documenting attributes grouped in a matching Content Description instance.  Describable Elements are intended to be published in method or process publications (similar to the IBM Rational Unified Process web).  Describable Element defines that the element it represents will have content 'attached' to it.  Content Description is the abstraction for the actual places in which the content is being represented.  This separation allows a distinction between core method model elements describing the structure of the model from the actual description container providing, for example, the documentation of the content element in different alternatives languages, audiences, licensing levels, etc.</xsd:documentation>

	<xsd:complexType name="Task">
		<xsd:annotation>
			<xsd:documentation>A Content Element that describes work being performed by Roles.  It defines one default performing Role as well as many additional performers.  A Task is associated to input and output work products.  Inputs are differentiated in mandatory versus optional inputs.  The associations to Work Products are not instantiatable/variable-like parameters.  They rather express (hyper-)links to the descriptions of the work products types that are related to the Task as inputs and outputs.  In other words, these associations are not intended to be used to capture which concrete instances will be passed when instantiating the method in a project.  All of the Task's default associations can be overridden in an actual process definition.
A Task describes an assignable unit of work.  Every Task is assigned to specific Roles.  The granularity of a Task is generally a few hours to a few days.  It usually affects one or only a small number of work products. A Task is used as an element of defining a process. Tasks are further used for planning and tracking progress; therefore, if they are defined too fine-grained, they will be neglected, and if they are too large, progress would have to be expressed in terms of a Task's parts (e.g. Steps, which is not recommended). 
A Task has a clear purpose in which the performing roles achieve a well defined goal.  It provides complete step-by-step explanations of doing all the work that needs to be done to achieve this goal.  This description is complete, independent of when in a process lifecycle the work would actually be done.  It therefore does not describe when you do what work at what point of time, but describes all the work that gets done throughout the development lifecycle that contributes to the achievement of this goal.  When the Task is being applied in a process then this process application (defined as Task Descriptor) provides the information of which pieces of the Task will actually be performed at any particular point in time. This assumes that the Task will be performed in the process over and over again, but each time with a slightly different emphasis on different steps or aspects of the task description. 
For example, a Task such as "Develop Use Case Model" describes all the work that needs to be done to develop a complete use case model. This would comprise of the identification and naming of use cases and actors, the writing of a brief description, the modeling of use cases and their relationships in diagrams, the detailed description of a basic flow, the detailed description of alternatives flows, performing of walkthroughs workshops and reviews, etc.  All of these parts contribute to the development goal of developing the use case model, but the parts will be performed at different points in time in a process.  Identification, naming, and brief descriptions would be performed early in a typical development process versus the writing of detailed alternative flows which would be performed much later.  All these parts or steps within the same Task define the "method" of Developing a Use Case Model.  Applying such a method in a lifecycle (i.e. in a process) is defining which steps are done when going from one iteration to the next.</xsd:documentation>

A process as defined in UMA (cf. with Sections XX and 5.2) is a multi-dimensional structure defining what work is being performed at what time by which roles using which input and producing what outputs.  A project plan as it is represented in project planning tools such as IBM Rational Portfolio Manager or Microsoft Project normally does not need all this information and is normally limited to just representing a subset.  For example, a typical MS Project plan only represents the work breakdown consisting of Tasks and Activities (sometimes referred to as summary tasks).  It does not show the input and output Work Products for a Task, but it can show which roles shall be staffed for performing the Task.  However, such role allocation need to be replaced with concrete resources when instantiating the plan for a concrete project.  Sometimes project plans can then again be organized differently by organizing work by deliverables in which Work Products are mapped to the plan's summary tasks and Task that have these work products as output mapped below such as summary task.  Therefore, a process can make recommendations about which elements to include and which to exclude when generating a plan.  When the isPlanned attribute is set to False for an instance of a Breakdown Element, then this element shall not be not included when a concrete project plan is being generated from the breakdown structure that contains this element.

Iteration groups a set of nested Activities that are repeated more than once.  It represents an important structuring element to organize work in repetitive cycles.  The concept of Iteration can be associated with different rules in different methods.  For example, the IBM Rational Unified Process method framework (RUP) defines a rule that Iterations are not allowed to span across Phases.  In contrast IBM Global Services Method (GSMethod) based method frameworks this rule does not apply and Iteration can be defined which nest Phases.  Rules like these, which play an important role for each individual method and are therefore not enforced by this meta-model.  Instead, process authors are expected to follow and check these rules manually.  (Note: Any Breakdown Element can be repeated; however, Iterations has been introduced as a special meta-model concept, because of its important role for many methods.)</xsd:documentation>

Work assignments and Work Product responsibilities can be different from Activity to Activity in a development project. Different phases require different staffing profiles, i.e. different skills and resources doing different types of work.  Therefore, a process needs to define such different profiles in a flexible manner.  Whereas Core Method Content defines standard responsibilities and assignments, a process express by a breakdown structures needs to be able refine and redefine these throughout its definition.  Role Descriptors, Resource Definitions, as well as Team Profiles provide the data structure necessary to achieve this flexibility and to provide a process user with the capability to define different teams and role relationships for every Activity (including Activities on any nesting-level as well as Iterations or Phases).
Hence, in addition to the work breakdown and work product breakdown structures defined so far, Team Profiles are used to define a third type of breakdown structure: team breakdown structures.  These are created as an Activity specific hierarchy of Team Profiles comprising of Role Descriptors and Resource Definitions.  These structures can be presented as well-known Org-Charts.  Just as with any other Breakdown Element and Descriptors, Team Profiles can be defined within the scope of any Activity in a breakdown structure.  In other words every Activity can define its own Team Profiles consisting of Activity specific Role Descriptors and Resource Definitions.

Core Method Content provides step-by-step explanations, describing how very specific development goals are achieved independent of the placement of these steps within a development lifecycle.

Thus, a process is a set of partially ordered work descriptions intended to reach a higher development goal, such as the release of a specific software system.

A Delivery Process is related to specific supporting information such as Roadmaps (inherited via Activity) as well as Communications and Education Material.
A Delivery Process is a Process that covers a whole development lifecycle from beginning to end.  A Delivery Process shall be used as a template for planning and running a project.  It provides a complete lifecycle model with predefined phases, iterations, and activities that have been detailed by sequencing referencing method content in breakdown structures.  It is defined on the basis of experience with past projects or engagements, and/or the best practice use of a development or delivery approach.  It defines what gets produced, how those items are produced, and the required staffing in the form of integrated Work, Work Product, and Team Breakdown Structures.  For example, a process engineer can define alternative Delivery Processes for software development projects that differ in the scale of the engagement and staffing necessary, the type of the software application to be developed, the development methods and technologies to be used, etc.  Although, the Delivery Process aims to cover a whole project it keeps certain decision that are too project specific open.  For example, the breakdown structure defines which Breakdown Elements have multiple occurrences or is repeatable via it respective attributes, but does not say how many occurrences and how many repeats/iterations it will have.  These decisions have to be done by a project manager when planning a concrete project, project phase, or project iterations.  A Delivery Process is always a complete description of a process in terms of completeness of the lifecycle, as well as in terms of all three views on the process which are the Work Breakdown Structure, Work Product Breakdown Structure, and Team Breakdown Structure have to be fully and consistently populated.

A Capability Pattern is a special Process that describes a reusable cluster of doing work in a general process area that provides a consistent development approach to common problems.  Examples for Capability Pattern could be 'use case-based requirements management', 'use case analysis', or 'unit testing'.

A capability pattern does not relate to any specific phase or iteration of a development lifecycle, and should not imply any.  In other words, a pattern should be designed in a way that it is applicable anywhere in a Delivery Process.  This enables its Activities to be flexibly assigned to whatever phases there are in the Delivery Process to which it is being applied.  It is a good practice to design a Capability Pattern to produce one or more generic Deliverables.  The typical configuration is that each Activity in the Capability Pattern produces one Deliverable, and the last Task Descriptor in the Activity explicitly outputs just this Deliverable.  This enables the process engineer to select Patterns or just Activities by deciding which Deliverables are required.  It also offers a simple integration approach: an Activity from a capability pattern is linked to the Phase or Iteration which is required to produce the Activity's Deliverable.  Key applications areas of / areas of reuse for Capability Patterns are:
- To serve as building blocks for assembling Delivery Processes or larger Capability Patterns.  Normally developing a Delivery Process is not done from scratch but by systematically applying and binding patterns.  In addition to the standard pattern application of 'copy-and-modify', which allows the process engineer to individually customize the pattern's content to the particular situation it is applied for, the Plugin meta-model package (Section 6.1) introduces even more sophisticated inheritance relationships that support dynamic binding of patterns (i.e. the pattern is referenced and not copied).  This unique new way of reusing process knowledge allows to factor out commonly reoccurring Activities into patterns and to apply them over and over again for a process.  When the pattern is being revised or updated, all changes will be automatically reflected in all pattern application in all processes because of the dynamic binding.
- To support direct execution in a development project that does not work following a well-defined process, but works based on loosely connected process fragments of best practices in a flexible manner (e.g. Agile Development).
- To support process education by describing knowledge for a key area such as best practices on how to perform the work for a Discipline (e.g. Requirements Management), for a specific development technique (aspect-oriented development), or a specific technical area (e.g. relational database design), which is used for education and teaching.</xsd:documentation>

	<xsd:complexType name="ProcessPlanningTemplate">
		<xsd:annotation>
			<xsd:documentation>A special Process that is prepared for instantiation by a project planning tool.  Typically, it is created based on a Process such as a Delivery Process as a whole (e.g. in case of a waterfall-based development approach) or in parts (e.g. in case of an iterative development approach).
A Process Planning Template represents a partially finished plan for a concrete project.  It uses the same information structures as all other Process Types to represent templates for project plans.  However, certain planning decisions have already been applied to the template as well as information has been removed and/or reformatted to be ready for export to a specific planning tool.  Examples for such decisions are: a template has been created to represent a plan for a particular Iteration in an iterative development project, which fr example distinguishes early from late iterations in the Elaboration phase of a project; if the targeted planning tool cannot represent input and output of Task, then these have been removed from the structure; certain repetitions have been already applied, e.g. stating that a cycle of specific Task grouped in an Activity have to be repeated n-times; etc.</xsd:documentation>

			<xsd:documentation>A special Process Package that applies the principles of encapsulation.  A Process Component realizes one or more Interfaces which specify inputs and outputs of the component. There might be many components realizing the same interfaces, but using different techniques to achieve similar outputs for similar inputs.  Whereas the Component Interfaces represent component specifications (black box descriptions of the component), good candidates for component realizations can be found in Capability Patterns (white box descriptions for the component).
UMA supports replaceable and reusable Process Components realizing the principles of encapsulation. Certain situations in a software development project might require that concrete realizations of parts of the process remain undecided or will be decided by the executing team itself (e.g. in outsourcing situations).  UMA provides a unique component concept defining interfaces for work product input and output, allowing treating the actual definition of the work that produces the outputs as a "black box".  At any point during a project the component "realization" detailing the work can be added to the process.  The component approach also allows that different styles or techniques of doing work can be replaced with one another.  For example, a software code output of a component could be produced with a model-driven development or a code-centric technique.  The component concept encapsulates the actual work and lets the development team choose the appropriate technique and fill the component's realization with their choice of Activities that produce the required outputs.</xsd:documentation>
