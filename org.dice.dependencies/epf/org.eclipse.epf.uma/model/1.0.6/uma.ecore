The effect after interpretation of contribution is that the base Variability Element is logically replaced with an augmented variant of the element that combines attribute values and association instances.  The way this combination is realized depends on the type of the attribute or association.  For example, String attributes are concatenated resolving embedded commands for dependent text or merging text fragments (e.g. descriptions for content elements).  Additional elements in to-many associations are added (e.g. additional Guidance elements or Task Descriptors of an Activity).  Different elements in to-one associations are ignored (e.g. the one Primary Performer of a Task).  Multiple Content Elements can contribute to the same base element and all of these contributions properties are added to the base in the same fashion. The following table provides the detailed list of interpretation rules:&#xA;attribute values:&#x9;String values from the special Variability Element are concatenated with values from the based-on Variability Element.

The result of interpretation is that the special element has the same properties as the based-on has, but might define its own additions.  Hence extends is not used to modify content of the base Plugin, but to provide the ability for the extending Plugin to define its own content which is a variant of content already defined (e.g. a special version of a generic Review Record for a specific type of review).  The effect of this is that the base Variability Element and any number of extending Variability Elements can be used side by side, but refer to each other via the extends relationship.  Extends also provides the key mechanism for binding Capability Patterns to Processes: A pattern is applied by defining an extends relationships from an Activity of the applying Processes to the Pattern.

        <details key="documentation" value="Replaces provides a way for Variability Elements to replace a base Variability Element without directly changing any of its existing properties.  This is in most cases used for Method Plugins that aim to replace specific Content Elements such as Roles, Task, or Activities with either a complete new variant or to change fundamental relationships of these elements (e.g. Role-Artifact responsibility).  Properties replaced are attribute values and association instances.  The effect of this is that the base Content Element is logically replaced with this new variant of the element to which all incoming associations still point as before, but which has potentially new attribute values and outgoing association properties.  This provides a very powerful mechanism to replace, for example, whole Activities in a Process with complete new realizations of the Activity.  For instance, replacing an Activity doing use case-based design with an activity doing agile code-centric development doing the same work using a different development technique utilizing different Roles, Tasks, etc.  Another example, would be to replace an Activity that describes database design for an RDBMS with an Activity that describes database design for an OODBMS.  A Variability Element can only be replaced by one other element at a time.  For example, if two Method Plugins replace the same element only one Method Plugin can be used for interpretation (see concept of Method Configuration for more details on how to resolve such conflicts, Section 7.1.2).  The following table provides the detailed list of interpretation rules:&#xA;attribute values:&#x9;Values from the special Variability Element are replaced with values from the based-on Variability Element including unassigned values.&#xA;The identifying attributes guid and name of Method Element are exempt from this rule and will not be modified.&#xA;0..1-association instances:&#x9;The one association instance of the based-on Variability Element is replaced with the association instance from the replacing special Variability Element.

      <details key="documentation" value="A Task is a content element that describes work being performed by Roles.  It defines one default performing Role as well as many additional performers.  A Task is associated to input and output work products.  Inputs are differentiated in mandatory versus optional inputs.  The associations to Work Products are not instantiatable/variable-like parameters.  They rather express (hyper-)links to the descriptions of the work products types that are related to the Task as inputs and outputs.  In other words, these associations are not intended to be used to capture which concrete instances will be passed when instantiating the method in a project.  All of the Task's default associations can be overridden in an actual process definition.&#xA;A Task describes an assignable unit of work.  Every Task is assigned to specific Roles.  The granularity of a Task is generally a few hours to a few days.  It usually affects one or only a small number of work products. A Task is used as an element of defining a process. Tasks are further used for planning and tracking progress; therefore, if they are defined too fine-grained, they will be neglected, and if they are too large, progress would have to be expressed in terms of a Task's parts (e.g. Steps, which is not recommended). &#xA;A Task has a clear purpose in which the performing roles achieve a well defined goal.  It provides complete step-by-step explanations of doing all the work that needs to be done to achieve this goal.  This description is complete, independent of when in a process lifecycle the work would actually be done.  It therefore does not describe when you do what work at what point of time, but describes all the work that gets done throughout the development lifecycle that contributes to the achievement of this goal.  When the Task is being applied in a process then this process application (defined as Task Descriptor) provides the information of which pieces of the Task will actually be performed at any particular point in time. This assumes that the Task will be performed in the process over and over again, but each time with a slightly different emphasis on different steps or aspects of the task description. &#xA;For example, a Task such as &quot;Develop Use Case Model&quot; describes all the work that needs to be done to develop a complete use case model. This would comprise of the identification and naming of use cases and actors, the writing of a brief description, the modeling of use cases and their relationships in diagrams, the detailed description of a basic flow, the detailed description of alternatives flows, performing of walkthroughs workshops and reviews, etc.  All of these parts contribute to the development goal of developing the use case model, but the parts will be performed at different points in time in a process.  Identification, naming, and brief descriptions would be performed early in a typical development process versus the writing of detailed alternative flows which would be performed much later.  All these parts or steps within the same Task define the &quot;method&quot; of Developing a Use Case Model.  Applying such a method in a lifecycle (i.e. in a process) is defining which steps are done when going from one iteration to the next.&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is the Guidance Types package's extension of Task (defined in Content Elements) providing additional associations."/>

A process as defined in UMA (cf. with Sections XX and 5.2) is a multi-dimensional structure defining what work is being performed at what time by which roles using which input and producing what outputs.  A project plan as it is represented in project planning tools such as IBM Rational Portfolio Manager or Microsoft Project normally does not need all this information and is normally limited to just representing a subset.  For example, a typical MS Project plan only represents the work breakdown consisting of Tasks and Activities (sometimes referred to as summary tasks).  It does not show the input and output Work Products for a Task, but it can show which roles shall be staffed for performing the Task.  However, such role allocation need to be replaced with concrete resources when instantiating the plan for a concrete project.  Sometimes project plans can then again be organized differently by organizing work by deliverables in which Work Products are mapped to the plan's summary tasks and Task that have these work products as output mapped below such as summary task.  Therefore, a process can make recommendations about which elements to include and which to exclude when generating a plan.

A process and the process meta-model structure defined in this specification focuses on the lifecycle and the sequencing of work in breakdown structures.  To achieve this it uses the Descriptor concept referencing method content and allowing defining time-specific customizations of the referenced content (e.g. defining a focus on different steps of the same Task and providing input Work Products in different states within the different Phases of a process lifecycle in which the same Task is performed).&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Process in the package Library Configuration extends the class Process with association relating a Process to one default and many optional valid Configurations.&#xA;These configurations describe valid contexts for the Process within a Method Library indicating under which Configurations a Process is well defined.&#xA;"/>

      <details key="documentation" value="A Capability Pattern is a special Process that describes a reusable cluster of doing work in common process areas.  Capabilities Patterns express and communicate process knowledge for a key area of interest such as a Discipline and can be directly used by process practitioner to guide his work.  They are also used as building blocks to assemble Delivery Processes or larger Capability Patterns ensuring optimal reuse and application of the key practices they express.&#xA;A Capability Pattern is a special Process that describes a reusable cluster of doing work in a general process area that provides a consistent development approach to common problems.  Examples for Capability Pattern could be 'use case-based requirements management', 'use case analysis', or 'unit testing'. Typically but not necessarily, Capability Patterns have the scope of one discipline providing a breakdown of reusable complex Activities, relationships to the Roles which perform Tasks within these Activities, as well as to the Work Products that are used and produced.  A capability pattern does not relate to any specific phase or iteration of a development lifecycle, and should not imply any.  In other words, a pattern should be designed in a way that it is applicable anywhere in a Delivery Process.  This enables its Activities to be flexibly assigned to whatever phases there are in the Delivery Process to which it is being applied.  It is a good practice to design a Capability Pattern to produce one or more generic Deliverables.  The typical configuration is that each Activity in the Capability Pattern produces one Deliverable, and the last Task Descriptor in the Activity explicitly outputs just this Deliverable.  This enables the process engineer to select Patterns or just Activities by deciding which Deliverables are required.  It also offers a simple integration approach: an Activity from a capability pattern is linked to the Phase or Iteration which is required to produce the Activity's Deliverable.  Key applications areas of / areas of reuse for Capability Patterns are:&#xA;- To serve as building blocks for assembling Delivery Processes or larger Capability Patterns.  Normally developing a Delivery Process is not done from scratch but by systematically applying and binding patterns.  In addition to the standard pattern application of 'copy-and-modify', which allows the process engineer to individually customize the pattern's content to the particular situation it is applied for, the Plugin meta-model package (Section 6.1) introduces even more sophisticated inheritance relationships that support dynamic binding of patterns (i.e. the pattern is referenced and not copied).  This unique new way of reusing process knowledge allows to factor out commonly reoccurring Activities into patterns and to apply them over and over again for a process.  When the pattern is being revised or updated, all changes will be automatically reflected in all pattern application in all processes because of the dynamic binding.&#xA;- To support direct execution in a development project that does not work following a well-defined process, but works based on loosely connected process fragments of best practices in a flexible manner (e.g. Agile Development).&#xA;- To support process education by describing knowledge for a key area such as best practices on how to perform the work for a Discipline (e.g. Requirements Management), for a specific development technique (aspect-oriented development), or a specific technical area (e.g. relational database design), which is used for education and teaching.&#xA;"/>
