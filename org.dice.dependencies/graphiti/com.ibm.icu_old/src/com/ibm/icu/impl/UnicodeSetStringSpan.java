     * remember to continue after it. + Either recursively span for each code point or string match, or recursively span

     * longest recursive span (the farthest end point). + If there is no match at the current position, neither for the
     * code point there nor for any set string, then stop and return the longest recursive span length.
     * 
     * Optimized implementation:
     * 
     * (We assume that most sets will have very few very short strings. A span using a string-less set is extremely
     * fast.)
     * 
     * Create and cache a spanSet which contains all of the single code points of the original set but none of its
     * strings.
     * 
     * - Start with spanLength=spanSet.span(SpanCondition.CONTAINED). - Loop: + Try to match each set
     * string at the end of the spanLength. ~ Set strings that start with set-contained code points must be matched with
     * a partial overlap because the recursive algorithm would have tried to match them at every position. ~ Set strings
     * that entirely consist of set-contained code points are irrelevant for span(SpanCondition.CONTAINED)
     * because the recursive algorithm would continue after them anyway and find the longest recursive match from their
     * end. ~ Rather than recursing, note each end point of a set string match. + If no set string matched after
     * spanSet.span(), then return with where the spanSet.span() ended. + If at least one set string matched after
     * spanSet.span(), then pop the shortest string match end point and continue the loop, trying to match all set
     * strings from there. + If at least one more set string matched after a previous string match, then test if the
     * code point after the previous string match is also contained in the set. Continue the loop with the shortest end
     * point of either this code point or a matching set string. + If no more set string matched after a previous string
     * match, then try another spanLength=spanSet.span(SpanCondition.CONTAINED). Stop if spanLength==0,
     * otherwise continue the loop.
     * 
     * By noting each end point of a set string match, the function visits each string position at most once and
     * finishes in linear time.
     * 
     * The recursive algorithm may visit the same string position many times if multiple paths lead to it and finishes

     * Algorithm for spanNot()==span(SpanCondition.NOT_CONTAINED)

     * is in the set, then return with the current position. + If a set string matches at the current position, then
     * return with the current position.
     * 
     * Optimized implementation:
     * 
     * (Same assumption as for span() above.)
     * 
     * Create and cache a spanNotSet which contains all of the single code points of the original set but none of its
     * strings. For each set string add its initial code point to the spanNotSet. (Also add its final code point for
     * spanNotBack().)
     * 
     * - Loop:
     *   + Do spanLength=spanNotSet.span(SpanCondition.NOT_CONTAINED).
     *   + If the current code point is in the original set, then return the current position.
     *   + If any set string matches at the current position, then return the current position.
     *   + If there is no match at the current position, neither for the code point
     * there nor for any set string, then skip this code point and continue the loop. This happens for

    /*
     * Helper class for UnicodeSetStringSpan.
     *
     * List of offsets from the current position from where to try matching a code point or a string. Store offsets rather
     * than indexes to simplify the code and use the same list for both increments (in span()) and decrements (in
     * spanBack()).
     * 
     * Assumption: The maximum offset is limited, and the offsets that are stored at any one time are relatively dense, that
     * is, there are normally no gaps of hundreds or thousands of offset values.
     * 
     * The implementation uses a circular buffer of byte flags, each indicating whether the corresponding offset is in the
     * list. This avoids inserting into a sorted list of offsets (or absolute indexes) and physically moving part of the
     * list.
     * 
     * Note: In principle, the caller should setMaxLength() to the maximum of the max string length and U16_LENGTH/U8_LENGTH
     * to account for "long" single code points.
     * 
     * Note: If maxLength were guaranteed to be no more than 32 or 64, the list could be stored as bit flags in a single
     * integer. Rather than handling a circular buffer with a start list index, the integer would simply be shifted when
     * lower offsets are removed. UnicodeSet does not have a limit on the lengths of strings.
