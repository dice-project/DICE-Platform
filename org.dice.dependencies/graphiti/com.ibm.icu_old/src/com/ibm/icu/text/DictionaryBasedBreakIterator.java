/**
 * A subclass of RuleBasedBreakIterator that adds the ability to use a dictionary
 * to further subdivide ranges of text beyond what is possible using just the
 * state-table-based algorithm.  This is necessary, for example, to handle
 * word and line breaking in Thai, which doesn't use spaces between words.  The
 * state-table-based algorithm used by RuleBasedBreakIterator_Old is used to divide
 * up text as far as possible, and then contiguous ranges of letters are
 * repeatedly compared against a list of known words (i.e., the dictionary)
 * to divide them up into words.
 *
 * DictionaryBasedBreakIterator uses the same rule language as RuleBasedBreakIterator_Old,
 * but adds one more special substitution name: _dictionary_.  This substitution
 * name is used to identify characters in words in the dictionary.  The idea is that
 * if the iterator passes over a chunk of text that includes two or more characters
 * in a row that are included in _dictionary_, it goes back through that range and
 * derives additional break positions (if possible) using the dictionary.
 *
 * DictionaryBasedBreakIterator is also constructed with the filename of a dictionary
 * file.  It uses Class.getResource() to locate the dictionary file.  The
 * dictionary file is in a serialized binary format.  We have a very primitive (and
 * slow) BuildDictionaryFile utility for creating dictionary files, but aren't
 * currently making it public.  Contact us for help.
 *
 * @stable ICU 2.0
